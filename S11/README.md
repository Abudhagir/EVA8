We have a 2 part assignment:

add these features to BERT training:
collect your own data (cannot be Shakespeare or any single file downloaded from the internet. Your sources should come from multiple URLs (basically copy paste 1000s of times)
noisy word prediction (swap any word 15% of times from a sentence with any other random word, and then predict the correct word):
Share a sample from your own dataset
Share the training log (Epochs/x = 10 logs)
Share 10 examples of input-output
implement sparse attention on your own in the GPT code that we wrote. Train on the data that you collected above:
Copy paste the code here for the sparse attention that you wrote
share the training log (Epochs/x = 10 logs)
Share 10 examples of output
